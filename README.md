The last thing theyâ€™d witnessed was the Summer sun in the fullness of its glory, and that light was still alive in the glass. It might never leave.

gonna make a perfect programming language. gonna make it with imperfect code.

`design` has rambling about design and motivation, but tldr its immutable statically typed lua

# progress

i started emitting llvm ir. it can print values and that's about it, unless this readme gets out of date in which case it can do more. run it like `lua src/main.lua && lli output.ll`.

todo is basically "add flow control back in, figure out how the hell cores will work via llvm, add mutations".

# building

this uses lualvm and is probably the only program in the history of the world to do so. you gotta install [inclua](https://github.com/gilzoide/inclua) which is some random dude's lua bindgen and then go to `lib/lualvm` and run `export CXX=clang++ && export CC=clang && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make && make install`. and also maybe remove LLVMCreateOprofileJITEventListener from /usr/include/llvm-c/ExecutionEngine.h. c'est la vie.

i wrote a parser in rust for this but its not hooked up. once that works you'll probably have to build that too.

better if you didn't, really.
