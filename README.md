>Over his palm hovered the shards that had once been his spectacles, and though the enchantments on them were gone there was something a great deal more dangerous to be glimpsed in them now. The last thing theyâ€™d witnessed was the Summer sun in the fullness of its glory, and that light was still alive in the glass. It might never leave.

gonna make a perfect programming language. gonna make it with imperfect code.

`design` has rambling about design and motivation, but tldr its immutable statically typed lua

# progress

it can build values, declare variables, do `if` statements, define cores, and evaluate arms of cores.
it either emits llvm (run it like `lua src/main.lua && lli output.ll`) or does a dumb tree walking interpreter.

todo is basically "add fetching through core contexts, add functions, add defered types, add mutations" and then hopefully i can evaluate factorials or whatever. also make the type system not utter trash.

# building

this uses lualvm and is probably the only program in the history of the world to do so. you gotta install [inclua](https://github.com/gilzoide/inclua) which is some random dude's lua bindgen and then go to `lib/lualvm` and run `export CXX=clang++ && export CC=clang && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make && make install`. and also maybe remove LLVMCreateOprofileJITEventListener from /usr/include/llvm-c/ExecutionEngine.h. c'est la vie.

i wrote a parser in rust for this but its not hooked up. once that works you'll probably have to build that too.

better if you didn't, really.
